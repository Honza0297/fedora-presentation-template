# Unofficial latex Fedora presentation slides

This is an unofficial repository for Fedora presentation slides. 

I have done only slight improvements, slides are mostly based on work of:

* Fedora design team official slides:  https://github.com/fedoradesign/fedora-presentation-template
* lruzicka's fork: https://github.com/lruzicka
* ...and more :) 

Titlepage without text fields (practicaly identical to Libreoffice template): 
![title slide](titlepage.png)

## Changelog

  * Initial github commit
  * Changed design to the new Fedora logo design
  * Add \blankpage{} command
